> **_Bio:_** 
I'm Eoin O'Connell, a junior at Harvey Mudd College studying computer and electrical engineering. My work focuses on digital signal processing and FPGA-based systems design. Outside the lab, I compete in cross country and track and field for the Claremont-Mudd-Scripps teams. When I'm not running or working, I am often playing guitar or piano as playing music is one of my core passions.

## Abstract

This project implements a **real-time 3-band equalizer** that can independently adjust low, mid, and high frequencies of an audio signal. Audio is input via a **1/8-inch auxiliary cable**, digitized by an **ADC**, processed on an **FPGA**, and output through a **DAC** to stereo speakers.

Three potentiometers allow live control of each frequency band, enabling hands-on EQ adjustment with **minimal latency**.

### Features
- Three adjustable bands:
  - Low: ~100–400 Hz
  - Mid: ~400 Hz–2 kHz
  - High: ~2–8 kHz
- Real-time digital filtering on an **iCE40 UltraPlus FPGA**
- **MCU-controlled** filter coefficients sent via SPI
- Stereo input/output using I²S protocol
- Bypass mode preserves original audio when knobs are neutral

### Hardware
- iCE40 UltraPlus FPGA
- STM32L432KC MCU
- PCM1808 ADC
- PCM5102 DAC
- 3 x potentiometers for EQ control
- Standard 1/8-inch audio input

### Usage
1. Connect an audio source to the ADC.
2. Adjust low, mid, and high potentiometers to modify EQ in real time.
3. Audio output is sent to speakers via the DAC.

All of our code is available on our [github](https://github.com/eoinoconnell04/E155-Project).

## Microcontroller overview

The MCU within our project was designed to take in inputs from three potentiometers, and create filter coefficient calculations with moving average filtering for a three-band equalizer. A script was written to calibrate the knobs based on sampling frequency, and moving average functions. The MCU was then tasked to send these filter coefficients over SPI to the FPGA. SPI transactions were verified using a Logic Analyzer. 

## FPGA overview

The FPGA on the other hand was used as the main brain for this project. To be able to recieve audio from the external ADC, an I2S peripheral, made by Lattice, was used to control the RX and TX internal modules. The RX module was designed to input/ latch the audio in, while the TX was used to create the necessary bit clk, LR clk, and latch the output audio. Along side this, the FPGA took in  SPI inputs from the MCU via written SPI verilog. The filtering was done using the internal peripheral MAC16 (Multiply-Accumulate) and was processed using a 16-bit biqud IRR filter fsm.

This is the top level RTL block diagram of our design. For clarity, we didn't expand the filter module or the spi module, but the internals of these modules are shown below. Additionally, we represented all coefficients as an array of 15 different 16 bit signals. In practice, our RTL has 15 different ports, on for each coefficient.

This is the diagram for the finite state machine that time multiplexes the DSP slice to do the multiply accumulate operations for the IIR filter. Our design contains 3 instantiations of this FSM, as we have 3 cascading filters.

# Testing and Methodology

## Testbenches

We thoroughly test benched our RTL throughout the design process to get a working output. We could never have gotten our pipelined filter and multiply accumulate to work otherwise.

Of course we started by testbenching the most basic modules and working our way up. We were dealing with zero output for the vast majority of the project. 

Eventually we worked our way up to the top level test bench, which we see here:

Here we modeled both I2S inputs and outputs from the ADC and DAC, and SPI inputs from the MCU. We were able to confirm that the audio coming in from I2S was being correctly filtered given the current coefficients coming in from the MCU.

## Decibal Meter

We used a decibal meter app on our phone to analyze the frequency response of our filters. We would play a tone on a computer connected to our filter input, and measure the decibals with each band open and at full attenuation. We found a max of around 1 dB drop when attenuating a band that did not include the target frequency (ie. a high pitch sound and cutting out mid frequencies), and over 10 dB when attenuating the target frequencies. This is a very significant reduction which we are very happy with. We could make the attenuation even steeper by adjusting the coefficients, or change our knobs to allow for boosts as well as cuts.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank Prof. Matthew Spencer for teaching us so much this semester. Additionally, a sepcial thanks to Xavier Walter for helping us debug countless problems this year and giving us the tools we needed to be successful. Finally, thanks to the rest of the HMC lab and stockroom staff.
