## Project Proposal

### Overview

We will create a **real-time 3-band equalizer (EQ)** that can independently remove or boost lows, mids, and highs in an incoming audio signal. The system will feature **three control knobs**, one for each frequency range.

The project will accept audio through a **standard 1/8-inch (3.5 mm) auxiliary input**, allowing playback from a computer or mobile device. The analog audio signal will be digitized by an **ADC**, processed in real time by an **FPGA** using digital filtering, and then converted back to analog via a **DAC** for playback through a speaker.

### Functional Specifications

- [ ] **Input / Output**:  
  Audio is input via a 1/8-inch aux cable and output through the digital lab’s speaker system.

- [ ] **Bypass Behavior**:  
  When all EQ knobs are in their default (neutral) positions, the output should closely match the original input audio.

- [ ] **Frequency Bands**:  
  The equalizer will feature three independently adjustable bands:
  - **Low band:** ~100 Hz – 400 Hz  
  - **Mid band:** ~400 Hz – 2 kHz  
  - **High band:** ~2 kHz – 8 kHz  

- [ ] **Control Interface:**  
  Each band will have its own **potentiometer** for analog gain adjustment (boost/cut).

- [ ] **Latency:**  
  The system will maintain real-time operation with **< 50 ms latency**, ensuring audio remains synchronized with video sources such as YouTube.

- [ ] **Verification:**  
  The final report will include theoretical frequency responses for each band and confirm them via hardware measurements.

#### **MCU Responsibilities**
- Read **three analog potentiometer inputs** (one per frequency band).
- Compute **IIR filter coefficients** based on knob positions.
- Transmit updated coefficients to the FPGA via **SPI**.
- Optionally control **DAC mute pin** for safe startup/shutdown.

### Performance Calculations

The key performance characteristics of our EQ filter are defined by the sampling rate, ADC/DAC bit rate, and FPGA processing speed.

**Sampling Rate / Nyquist:**  
By the Shannon–Nyquist theorem, the sampling frequency must exceed twice the highest signal frequency. Since our high band extends to ~8 kHz, $f_s > 16\,\text{kHz}$.  
We will use **48 kHz**, providing a 24 kHz Nyquist limit and headroom for filtering.

**Bit Rate:**  
At 48 kHz, 24 bits/sample, and stereo audio:  

$$
R = f_s \times B \times C = 48{,}000 \times 24 \times 2 \approx 2.3\,\text{Mbps}
$$  

With 32-bit I²S frames, the bit clock is approximately **3 MHz**, easily handled by the FPGA.

**FPGA Throughput and Latency:**  
With a 50 MHz fabric clock:  

$$
\frac{50\,\text{MHz}}{48\,\text{kHz}} \approx 1000
$$  

cycles per sample—ample for three IIR filters.  
The ADC/DAC and pipeline add only a few samples of delay (<1 ms total).  
Even with conservative buffering, end-to-end latency remains **≪ 50 ms**, meeting our real-time requirement.

**Resolution / Noise:**  
24-bit audio provides ~146 dB theoretical SNR; internal 32-bit accumulation will preserve precision and avoid quantization noise.

Overall, the design easily meets real-time performance needs: 48 kHz sample rate, <1 ms latency, and sufficient precision for transparent audio quality.
