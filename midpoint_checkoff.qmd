## Overview

As of today, we are on track for our final deliverables. Yesterday, we played unfiltered audio from a computer through a TX signal chain, ADC, FPGA, DAC and finally to the lab speakers. This was a big accomplishment as we spent multiple days debugging why our ADC and DAC were not functioning as intended.

Filtering update

All parts have been ordered (ADC, DAC, audio jacks), as all other parts (opamps, resistors, trim pots, etc.) are all from the stockroom.
